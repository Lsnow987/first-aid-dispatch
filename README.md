The goal of this project is to create an app where member of first aid's location is automatically updated every few minutes and stored in a database.

Then when someone needs help and calls the dispatcher, the dispatcher will put in the location of the incident and the app will notify the 5 or so closest people to the incident.

The first one to accept will immediately cause a message to be sent to the dispatcher and other first-aid workers that the incident is being taken care of.
